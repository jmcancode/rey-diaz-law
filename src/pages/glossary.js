            <p className="text-left">
              The statute of limitations is essentially how long you have to
              file an injury claim against the at-fault person, business, or
              insurance company. For example, the state of Texas has a statute
              of limitations of three (3) years on most injury claims. If you
              are getting close to three (3) years from your injury and are
              still hurting, you need to find a personal injury attorney like
              The Rey Diaz. Your attorney will be able to file your case with
              your county’s court system so that you can continue treatment and
              still receive a settlement for your ongoing injuries.

            <p className="text-left">
              Personal Injury Protection (PIP) is very useful to you should you
              ever get into a motor vehicle accident. However, PIP is not
              required in Washington State. When you first sign up for car
              insurance your insurance agent should ask if you would like PIP
              added to your policy. If you reject, you will have to sign a
              waiver form (if they do not ask and you do not sign a PIP waiver,
              you automatically have PIP on your policy). PIP can be used
              whether or not you are at fault for the accident. If you are a
              pedestrian or bicyclist who is hit by a motor vehicle, the
              at-fault driver’s PIP will also cover you.
              <br />
              <br /> Here are just a few of the injury-related bills that PIP
              will pay for: Hospital visits, Urgent care or clinic visits,
              Radiology Chiropractic, physical therapy, and massage visits Time
              loss if you are unable to work Household help if you are unable to
              complete chores around the house.

            <p className="text-left">
              Underinsured Motorist coverage (UIM) is another car insurance
              policy addition that is useful in a motor vehicle accident. All
              insurance policies have limits, which is the most the insurance
              company will pay out. If the at-fault driver’s insurance limits do
              not cover all your medical bills, then a UIM claim will be opened
              with your insurance. Once the claim is open, your attorney will
              send a demand to the insurance adjuster and hopefully receive a
              settlement without the need to file a lawsuit. It is essentially
              the same as a liability or UM claim. Many insurance adjusters and
              policies use UIM and UM interchangeably; however, it’s good to
              know the difference between the two. A UIM claim will only be
              opened if your liability claim settles but doesn’t cover all of
              your expenses. A UM claim will only be opened if the at-fault
              driver has no insurance.

            <p className="text-left">
              A contingency fee is the money your personal injury attorney
              receives only after your case settles. This fee is a usually a
              percentage of your settlement and can be found in your contract.
              Contingency fees are very common in personal injury cases and
              sometimes fluctuate percentages based on whether or not the
              attorney will have to file a lawsuit. Always make sure you know
              whether or not your attorney works on a contingency fee basis.

            <p className="text-left">
              Liability is a term used to describe responsibility for something.
              For example, the driver that caused a motor vehicle accident is
              liable for the accident. In Washington State, liability for an
              accident can be split when no one is sure who caused the accident.

            <p className="text-left">
              Uninsured Motorist coverage (UM) is a car insurance policy
              addition that can help you in a motor vehicle accident. If the
              at-fault driver does not have any insurance, you would be unable
              to file a liability claim to receive a settlement. However, if you
              added UM to your own policy, you can open a UM claim to receive
              compensation for your injuries. A UM claim works the same way a
              UIM or liability claim works. Your attorney will send a demand to
              your insurance adjuster and hopefully obtain settlement without
              filing a lawsuit. Many insurance adjusters and policies use UM and
              UIM interchangeably; however, it’s good to know the difference
              between the two. A UM claim will only be opened if the at-fault
              driver has no insurance. A UIM claim will only be opened if your
              liability claim settles but doesn’t cover all of your expenses.

            <p className="text-left">
              The plaintiff is the person who opens a claim against another
              party. In personal injury cases, the plaintiff is usually the
              person who was injured and the defendant is the person who either
              directly or indirectly caused the injury.

            <p className="text-left">
              Depositions are sworn statements obtained out of court and written
              down if needed for a lawsuit. Depositions can be requested by
              either the plaintiff’s attorney (requesting to depose the
              defendant) or the defendant’s attorney (requesting to depose the
              plaintiff). During a deposition, you will be asked questions about
              what occurred during and after the accident by the opposing
              party’s attorney. A court reporter will also likely be present to
              accurately record what is being said.

              <p>
                Before your deposition, your attorney will discuss with you the
                ins and outs of giving a statement. Your attorney will also be
                with you during the deposition. However, you will be unable to
                ask your attorney any other questions while the deposition is
                taking place. Some questions asked by the opposing attorney can
                cause stress or annoyance, but if the questions become too
                bothersome, your attorney may object to them.

            <p className="text-left">
              Workers compensation is a type of insurance that pays for medical
              expenses and time/wages lost for workers injured while on the job.
              If you are injured on the job, rather than use your health
              insurance, you should instead use your workers compensation. In
              Washington State, most workers compensation claims are handled by
              the Washington Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). If you
              are injured on the job, you will have to open a claim with L&I and
              have it approved in order for your expenses to be paid. When you
              go into treatment, you will give the L&I claim number to your
              providers for payment.
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                During your treatment, L&I will obtain reports of your treatment
                and close your claim when a physician has declared you are back
                to your pre-injury status. However, sometimes L&I closes claims
                without a physician’s approval while you are still seeking
                treatment. In these cases, your attorney will petition L&I to
                reopen your claim.
